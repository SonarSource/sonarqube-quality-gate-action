SonarQube is the leading product for Continuous Code Quality & Code Security. It supports most popular programming languages, including Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, C#, Python, C, C++, and many more.

## Requirements

Repository with SonarQube analysis results.

## Usage

The workflow, usually declared in `.github/workflows/build.yml`, should look like this:

```yaml
on:
  # Trigger analysis when pushing in master or pull requests, and when creating
  # a pull request. 
  push:
    branches:
      - master
  pull_request:
      types: [opened, synchronize, reopened]
name: Main Workflow
jobs:
  sonarqube:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      with:
        # Disabling shallow clone is recommended for improving relevancy of reporting
        fetch-depth: 0
      #Triggering SonarQube analysis as results of it is required by Quality Gate check
    - name: SonarQube Scan
      uses: sonarsource/sonarqube-scan-action@master
      env:
        SONAR_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SONAR_TOKEN }}
        SONAR_HOST_URL: ${{ secrets.SONAR_HOST_URL }}
    - name: SonarQube Quality Gate check
      uses: sonarsource/sonarqube-quality-gate-action@master
      # Force to fail step after specific time
      timeout-minutes: 5
      env:
       SONAR_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SONAR_TOKEN }}

```

You can change the location of the report metadata file by using the optional `scanMetadataReportFile` input:

```yaml
uses: sonarsource/sonarqube-quality-gate-action@master
with:
  scanMetadataReportFile: target/sonar/report-task.txt
```

### Environment variables

- `SONAR_TOKEN` – **Required** – this token is used to authenticate access to SonarQube. You can read more about security tokens [here](https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/user-guide/user-token/). You need to set the `SONAR_TOKEN` environment variable in the "Secrets" settings page of your repository.
